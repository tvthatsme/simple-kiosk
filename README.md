# Kiosk Helper

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation. The app uses a text file to store kiosk information that visitors enter if they are interested in learning more or keeping in touch. I know that there are all kinds of forms and solutions for this but wanted to flex those developer muscles and take the do-it-yourself approach. Feel free to fork and adapt for yourself!
